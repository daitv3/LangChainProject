    " \n",
    "There are many patterns for building applications with LLMs. \n",

    "[We can embed LLM calls into pre-defined workflows](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/tutorials/workflows/), giving the system more agency to make decisions. \n",

    "\n",
    "We can further increase agency, allowing the LLM to dynamically direct its own tool usage. \n",
    "\n",
    "[Agents](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/tutorials/workflows/#agent) are typically implemented as tool calling in a loop, where the output of each tool call is used to inform the next action.\n",
    "\n",
    "![agent_example](img/agent_example.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Agents are well suited to open-ended problems where it's difficult to predict the *exact* steps needed in advance.\n",

    "## What is LangGraph? \n",
    "\n",
    "[LangGraph](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/concepts/high_level/) provides low-level supporting infrastructure that sits underneath *any* workflow or agent. \n",
    "\n",
    "It does not abstract prompts or architecture, and provides a few benefits:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Control**: Make it easy to define and / or combine agents and workflows.\n",
    "- **Persistence**: Provide a way to persist the state of a graph, which enables both memory and human-in-the-loop.\n",
    "- **Testing, Debugging, and Deployment**: Provide an easy onramp for testing, debugging, and deploying applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Control\n",
    "\n",
    "LangGraph lets you define your application as a graph with:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. *State*: What information do we need to track over the course of the application?\n",
    "2. *Nodes*: How do we want to update this information over the course of the application?\n",
    "3. *Edges*: How do we want to connect these nodes together?\n",
    "\n",
    "We can use the [`StateGraph` class](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/concepts/low_level/#graphs) to initialize a LangGraph graph with a [`State` object](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/concepts/low_level/#state).\n",
    "\n",
    "`State` defines the schema for information we want to track over the course of the application. \n",
    "\n",
    "This can be any object with `getattr()` in python, such as a dictionary, dataclass, or Pydantic object: \n",
    "\n",
    "- TypeDict is fastest but doesn’t support defaults\n",
    "- Dataclass is basically as fast, supports dot syntax `state.foo`, and has defaults. \n",
    "- Pydantic is slower (especially with custom validators) but gives type validation."

      "1. **Clear Subject Line**: Use a concise and informative subject line that summarizes the email's content.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Professional Greeting**: Start with a polite greeting, using the recipient's name if possible.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Be Concise**: Keep your message brief and to the point. Avoid unnecessary jargon and long-winded explanations.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Use Proper Formatting**: Break your email into paragraphs for better readability. Use bullet points or numbered lists for clarity when necessary.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Be Polite and Respectful**: Use courteous language and maintain a professional tone throughout the email.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **State Your Purpose Early**: Clearly state the purpose of your email in the opening lines to set the context.\n",
      "\n",
      "7. **Include a Call to Action**: If you need a response or action from the recipient, make it clear what you expect.\n",
      "\n",
      "8. **Proofread**: Check for spelling and grammatical errors before sending. A well-written email reflects professionalism.\n",
      "\n",
      "9. **Use a Professional Signature**: Include your name, title, and contact information at the end of the email.\n",
      "\n",
      "10. **Consider Timing**: Be mindful of when you send your email, especially if it’s time-sensitive or if the recipient is in a different time zone.\n",
      "\n",
      "11. **Avoid All Caps**: Writing in all caps can come across as shouting. Use standard capitalization.\n",
      "\n",
      "12. **Be Mindful of Tone**: Since emails lack vocal tone, be careful with your wording to avoid misunderstandings.\n",
